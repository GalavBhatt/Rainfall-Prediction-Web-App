# About Rainfall Predictor
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and it includes the data of Australia.
Our model predicts the rainfall on the basis of prominent features like:
###### Date
###### Maximum Temmperature
###### Evaporation
###### Location
###### Wind Speed
###### Humidity
etc.
##### various classification models have been tried like KNN,XGboost,SVM, logistic regression, Random forest classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Each model except KNN gives F-Score of 1.
##### Further, after creation of model a flask based web app is created so that the user can interact with it and leverage the model which we have build.
